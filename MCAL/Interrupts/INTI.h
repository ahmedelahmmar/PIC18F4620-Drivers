 * @brief Internal Interrupt (INTI) Interface
 *
 * The INTI interface simplifies interrupt management on a microcontroller, offering functions to initialize,
 * configure, and handle interrupts. It abstracts low-level interrupt settings, providing an organized way to
 * manage hardware events and execute corresponding actions. This interface enhances code readability,
 * promotes efficient interrupt handling, and supports smooth integration of interrupt-driven operations.
 *
 * @note The file is documented, offering clear insights into each function's purpose, parameters, return values,
 *       and usage examples.
 * @note The INTI interface ensures portability and can be utilized across different microcontroller families
 *       and development environments.
